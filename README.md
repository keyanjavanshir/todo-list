This is my personal todo project application. It is a testing and learning environment for using technologies and skills learned the past month.

// STEP 1:

Develop a todo application with simple concepts using plain Javascript and ES6-modules.
This application will be developed using minimal resources, as it is a project to enforce Active Recall. 
ChatGPT has been used for sparring when hitting a roadblock.

Concepts:

- localStorage
- JSON.parse() + JSON.stringify()
- DOM manipulation
- ES6 modules
- Null handling
- Refactoring -> DRY principles
- Error handling
- Clean Code
- Git commands with SSH
- Remote repositories


// STEP 2:

Concepts:

- RESTful API
- CRUD operations
- Setting up a database (MongoDB)
- Setting up .env variables
- Asynchronous JavaScript
- Typescript (Not learned yet)
- Express
- NodeJS
- MongoDB
- Nodemon
- Server/Client
- HTTP responses and status codes
