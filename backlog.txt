// Simple version

The goal is to create a todo list
The user can input a title for the todo-list and a description

This data will be saved in localStorage using setLocalStorage() and will be shown used getLocalStorage() // Remember to use JSON.stringify
Each time the user presses the create todo list,
The software will go through our localStorage and display the info through a JSON.parse()


The software should be able to:

1. Create new todo notes
2. Delete existing todo notes
3. Updating existing todo notes
4. Check off existing notes to log if the action has been completed




// Advanced version

In the advanced todo list, we will develop a REST API
That means, creating a collection using MongoDB and saving the data for each todo using CRUD operations

Instead of using localStorage, we can create the skeleton for a REST application that can access real data
The goal is to visualise the data by creating forms through the database, this could either be through handlebars or plain javascript
